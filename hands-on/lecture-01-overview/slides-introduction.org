#+TITLE: Bio 204: Biological Data Analysis
#+AUTHOR: Paul M. Magwene 
#+DATE: 29 August 2016 

* Welcome

-  Introductions
-  What is "Biological Data Analysis"?
-  Grading and course policies
-  Course Overview

* Teaching Team

** Instructor

-  Paul Magwene -- Associate Professor, Department of Biology; Director of Graduate Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics

** TA

-  Cullen Roth -- Graduate student in the University Program in Genetics and Genomics. Extensive mathematical and statistical computing experience.

* What is "Biological Data Analysis"?

- Scientific Computing

  - Data visualization, exploration, description
  - Data "munging" -- converting, combining, filtering, subsetting, and restructuring complex data 
  - Reproducible computational research
  - Simulation

- Statistics -- the science of learning from data

  - Classic parametric and non-parametric methods -- $t$-tests, ANOVA,
    regression, etc
  - Machine learning -- clustering, classification, dimensionality
    reduction, etc
  
* Computing Environment: R / RStudio

* Syllabus, First Third

- Getting up to speed with R
- Data visualization and exploration
- Quantitative measures for describing univariate and bivariate data 
- Regression and curve fitting
  
* Syllabus, Second Third

- Probability 
- Statistical distributions

- Central Limit Theorem
  
* Syllabus, Last Third

- Confidence Intervals
- Hypothesis testing and statistical power
- \(t\)-tests
- ANOVA

- $\chi^2$ and contingency tables


* Course policies: Academic Integrity

- All students are expected to adhere to and have an obligation to act in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

- Strict adherence to the plagiarism policy described in the Community Standard will be observed. Any violations of the community standard will be referred to the undergraduate judicial board. 

- Students are encouraged to study together and discuss the course material.


* Course policies: Missed classes

- Religious/Athletic/Interviews -- Must notify instructor at least *one week* in advance about missed class time.  

- Illness -- STINF or letter from academic dean if long-term illness.

- Students with excused absences other than illness are still expected to submit problem sets by assigned dates.

* Grading

** Quizzes 
In-class quizzes related to readings and lecture material from previous classes. Multiple choice or short answer.

** Problem sets
Weekly statistical and computational problems based on the material covered in lectures and the readings. 12 assignments total; lowest score dropped.

** Late assignments
Homework assignments that are submitted late without a STINF or instructor approval will receive half credit if submitted within 24 hours of the due date, or zero credit thereafter.

* Bonus points for on-time assignment completion

Students completing all problem sets and quizzes on time, and without any excused absences or STINFs, will receive bonus points towards their final grade.
