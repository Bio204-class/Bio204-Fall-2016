# Problem 1 (2 pts)

Pick four functions from the ggplot library that we have not discussed in class, write brief descriptions (in your own words) of what these functions do, and then provide brief code example illustrating their use (don't simply repeat the examples from the documentation!).  Use any of the data set examples we have discussed in class in your code, or consider data sets from the [R Datasets Package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) (the Datasets package is installed and loaded by default in a stock R setup).

# Problem 2

The file [possums.txt](https://github.com/Bio204-class/bio204-datasets/raw/master/possum.txt) is a tab-delimited file that contains morphological measurements on 104 brushtail possums (*Trichosurus vulpecula*). This data set contains information on variables such as sex, age, head length, skull width, tail length, and total body length, as well as information about the population and locality (site) at which each specimen was collected.


## Problem 2.1: Creating summary tables (3 pts)

Use the `dplyr` functions `group_by` and `summarise`, and the built-in function `as.data.frame`, to generate the table below, which gives the mean values of each of the four morphological variables (`headL`, `skullW`, `totalL`, and `tailL`) grouped by population and sex.

Your expected output should look like:
```
    pop sex mean.headL mean.skullW mean.totalL mean.tailL
1 other   f   91.81579    56.51579    87.36842   38.07895
2 other   m   92.99231    57.33333    86.50513   37.75641
3   Vic   f   92.41250    56.64583    88.33333   36.33333
4   Vic   m   92.80000    56.66364    86.52273   35.50000
```

```{r}
# Problem 2.1 code
```


## Problem 2.2: Boxplots (4 pts)

Using ggplot, recreate the boxplot given below that shows the tail length of possums, conditional on population and sex.

Expected output:

```{r}
# Problem 2.2 code
```

## Problem 2.3: Scatterplots (4 pts)

Using ggplot and the `facet_grid` function, recreate the figure below that shows tail length vs total length, broken down by population and sex.
