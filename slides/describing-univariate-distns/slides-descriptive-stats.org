** Overview
- Terminology for describing univariate distributions
- Measures of location (centrality)
- Measures of dispersion (spread)

** Population

Population -- A population is a collection of objects, individuals, or observations about which we intend to make general statements.

Examples: 

- The height of American males older than 25 years of age.
- Number of mitochondrial 12S-rRNA haplotypes in the human population
- Number of loblolly pine trees per km2 in North Carolina

** Sample / Random Sample

A sample is a subset of the population.

A Random Sample is a sample that is chosen in such a way as to reflect the
uncertainty of observations in a population.


** Types of data
- Categorical or Nominal -- labels matter but no mathematical notion of order or distance
  + Sex: Male / Female
  + Species

- Ordinal data -- order matters but no distance metric 
  + Juvenile, Adult
  + Small, Medium, Large
  + Muddy, Sandy, Gravelly

- Discrete, Integer, Counting
  + Number of vertebrae in a snake
  + Number of pine trees in a specified area
  + Number of heart beats in a minute
  + Number of head bobs during courtship display

- Continuous
  - Body mass
  - Length of right femur
  - Duration of aggressive display

** Interval vs Ratio scales

- Interval scales -- have meaningful order and distance metrics, but don't usually have a meaningful zero value, so computing ratios don't make sense

- Ratio scales -- have a meaningful order, distance metrics, and zero value.


** Statistic

A statistic is a numerical value calculated by applying a function (algorithm) to the values of the items of a sample 


** Example data set: butterfat data 

We'll use a data set that records the butter fat percentage in milk from 120 Canadian dairy cows (Sokal and Rohlf, Biometry, 4th ed)

- See the link on the course wiki for ~butterfat.csv~
- Load ~butterfat.csv~ using the ~read.csv~ function


** Generate a histogram

Using the ~ggplot2~ library, generate a histogram for the butterfat data set.

* Measures of location
** Mean
- Most common measure of location
- Measure of location that minimizes the sum of the squared deviations around it
- Statistical measure of location that has the smallest standard error (to be defined later)
- Physical analogy: If we think of observations as points of mass on a line, the mean is the center of mass (balance point)

Let $X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$. The mean of $\mathbf{x}$ is:

\[
\overline{X}= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i 
\]


** Median
- The middle point of a frequency distribution
- The value of the variable that has an equal number of items on either side of items

The median is a _robust_ estimator of location. Robust statistics are those that are not strongly affected by outliers our violations of model assumptions.  

** Robustness of median: Example

Changes in estimates of location when three outlier values (8, 10, 15) are added to butterfat data.

** Mode
- The most common value (or interval) in a distribution
- Unimodal, bimodal, multi-modal

[[file:unimodal-and-bimodal.pdf]]

** Some other "means"
*Weighted mean* -- useful when there is some a priori notion of weight or importance for different observations
\[
\overline{X}_w = \frac{1}{(\sum^n w_i)} \sum^n w_i x_i
\]
where the $w_i$ represent the weights attached to each observation.

*Geometric mean* -- most often used to study proportional growth (populations, tissues, organs, etc)
\[
GM_X = \sqrt[n]{\prod^n x_i}
\]

*Harmonic mean* -- rarely used in biology.
\[
HM_X = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n \frac{1}{x_i}
\]



* Measures of dispersion
** Range
- The difference between the largest and smallest items in a sample

\[
\max(\mathbf{x}) - \min(\mathbf{x})
\]

** Deviates 

*Deviate* -- the difference between an observation and the mean; can be negative or positive. Units same as the $x_i$.
\[
x_i - \overline{X}
\]

*Squared deviate* -- the square of a deviate; always $\geq 0$ (units$^2$).
\[
(x_i - \overline{X})^2
\]

*Sum of squared deviations* -- the sum of all the squared deviations in a sample (units$^2$). 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{X})^2
\]

** Variance and standard deviation

*Variance* -- the mean squared deviation (units$^2$).
\[
\sigma_X^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{X})^2 
\]

*Standard deviation* -- the square root of the variance (units same as the $x_i$).
\[
\sigma_X = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{X})^2}
\]

The above are the _population_ variance and standard deviation.  


** Sample estimators of variance and standard deviation

The /unbiased/ _sample_ estimators of the variance and standard deviation are given by:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\mbox{Variance:}\qquad & s_X^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{X})^2 \\
\mbox{Standard deviation:}\qquad & s_X = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{X})^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX

*You almost always want to use the sample estimators of variance and standard deviation.*

** Standard deviation rules of thumb

If data are normally distributed:

- Approximately 68% of observations fall within 1 standard deviation about the mean
- Approximately 95% of observations fall within 2 standard deviations about the mean 
- Approximately 99.7% of observations fall within 3 standard deviations about the mean

[[file:sd-rule-thumb.pdf]]

** Coefficient of variation
- Standard deviation expressed as percentage of mean
- Unitless measure

\[
V = \frac{s_X \times 100}{\overline{X}}
\]



** Quantiles, quartiles, interquartile range
- *Quantiles* -- points that will divide a frequency distribution into equal sized groups
  + quartiles -- points dividing a distribution into 4 equal groups
  + deciles -- points dividing a distribution into 10 equal groups
  + percentiles -- points dividing a distribution into 100 equal groups
- *Interquartile range (IQR)*-- range of values that captures the central 50% of the distribution 
  + Q1 = lower quartile, Q3 = upper quartile 


** Boxplots typically depict information about quartiles

** Median absolute deviation (MAD)
- A robust estimator of dispersion

\[
\mathrm{MAD}(X) = \mathrm{median}(|x_i - \mathrm{median}(X)|) 
\]

For normal distribution, $\sigma_X \approx 1.486 \times \mathrm{MAD}(X)$. 


* Skewness
** Skewness
- Skewness describes asymmetry of distributions

[[file:skewed-distributions.png]]

Common measure of skewness:

\[
\mbox{skewness} = E\left[\left(\frac{(x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^3\right]
\]
